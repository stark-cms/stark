# Stark

> The north remembers

Stark is the Open Source Headless CMS we've been missing in python.

## About

The project is still being developed but we have the following goals

- Lightweight - Stark is built using flask so it should end with a small footprint
- Flexible - Stark uses mongo and pymongo, you can control your content as you like
- Extensible - Clone the CMS and make it your own
- Production Ready - Stark should work right off the bat. You will be able to deploy to your favorite cloud quickly
- and most importatly: Headless - create and receive content through a json api, it will fit perfectly on your microservices infrastructure, will integrate nicely on your fancy frontend and mostly will be out of your way. We do provide a default frontend, but you can opt-out of it easily
